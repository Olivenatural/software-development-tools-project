# World Happiness Report Streamlit Dashboard ## Project Overview

This project visualizes and analyzes data from the **World Happiness Report**. The tool simulates random events related to the dataset and allows users to explore the relationships between factors affecting global happiness scores. The visualizations include histograms, scatter plots, and other interactive elements that can be customized by the user.

- **Interactive Scatter Plot**: Visualize the correlation between happiness scores and other factors.
- **Checkbox Filters**: Toggle between displaying different types of visualizations (scatter plot, histogram).
- **Dynamic Data Selection**: Select columns dynamically to explore different data visualizations.
  
## Libraries and Technologies Used
- **Streamlit**: For building the web application and creating interactive components.
